### The Motivation of the Project
The motivation behind our procedural graphics project is to capture the awe-inspiring beauty and complexity of natural landscapes, specifically focusing on islands. Our goal is to create a dynamic, procedurally generated island environment that is not only visually stunning but also reflects the unpredictable and diverse nature of these landscapes. Inspired by the procedural generation techniques seen in video games like "No Man's Sky" and "Minecraft," as well as the intricate simulations in film CGI, we aim to blend art and technology to simulate realistic environmental elements such as clouds, water, and wildlife. This project is an ambitious endeavor to push the boundaries of computer graphics, offering potential applications in game development, film, and environmental visualization. Through our work, we hope to showcase the power of procedural generation in creating immersive, ever-changing virtual worlds that captivate and inspire.

### High-Level Explanation
We are working on an advanced procedural graphics project that skillfully combines procedural generation in Houdini with Unity's robust rendering capabilities. In Houdini, we create dynamic, animated maps alongside unique island terrains and realistic cloud simulations, which are then exported to Unity. Within Unity, we elevate the environment with custom water and fog shaders, a skybox, and various assets from the Unity Asset Store, including a tailored butterfly flocking simulation for specific visual effects. This comprehensive approach results in a visually arresting, immersive island landscape that showcases our expertise in blending intricate procedural generation with sophisticated rendering techniques.

### Technical Breakdown - Houdini

**Cloud Simulation:** We used Houdini's metaballs to create dynamic cloud simulations, lending a fluid and lifelike quality to our clouds. By applying a combination of noises and cloud nodes, each cloud gained a realistic texture. The clouds are animated to demonstrate natural behaviors like collisions and merging, contributing to the environmental realism. This procedural approach allows the clouds to move organically around the island, enhancing the scene's dynamic feel.

**Map:** Our map generation process started with designing a pattern texture in Photoshop. This texture served as a foundation for the wave function collapse node in Houdini, allowing us to generate a variety of similar yet distinct map patterns procedurally. This technique resulted in a diverse range of maps, each featuring unique island shapes and sizes, adding depth and variety to our projectâ€™s landscape.

**Island:** In crafting the islands, we employed Houdini's advanced procedural techniques to sculpt realistic terrains. This involved using noise algorithms and distancing for terrain bottoms, and the Houdini brush tool to generate elevation for terrain top geometries, ensuring each island had its own distinct character. We focused on details such as elevation variations,  and integrating natural features like grass and vines to imbue each island with a sense of authenticity and detail.


### Technical Breakdown - Unity

**Fog:** We've developed a sophisticated fog system by calculating the fog intensity based on the camera's position. This involves determining the distance between the camera and the fog's start and endpoints. The result is then normalized by dividing by the distance between these points and clamped between 0 and 1 to yield the final fog intensity for each pixel. This technique allows for a realistic and dynamic fog effect that adjusts seamlessly with the camera's movement, enhancing the atmospheric depth of our scene.

**Water:** Our water simulation is crafted using a blend of two normal textures to mimic the movement of water waves. To add realism, we've incorporated Blinn-Phong lighting, simulating the interplay of sunlight on the water's surface. The key to our reflection effect is a specially created reflection camera that renders the scene inversely, storing the outcome in a texture. This texture is then processed using the Kawase Blur method for a softened, realistic reflection. We map this blurred texture onto a planar surface, achieving a highly convincing water appearance with dynamic reflections and lighting.

**Butterfly:** For the butterfly flocking effect, we utilized a Unity Asset from the Asset Store. However, to tailor it to our specific requirements, we modified the included flocking script. Our customizations were focused on creating optimal boid behaviors that perfectly complement our scene. This bespoke approach allowed us to integrate the butterfly flocking seamlessly into our environment, contributing to the dynamic and organic feel of the landscape. The result is a beautifully orchestrated movement of butterflies that enhances the overall visual appeal and lifelike quality of our project.

### Integration and Optimization

The second milestone in our project marked significant progress, building on the foundational work accomplished in Milestone 1. Our focus was on merging the individual elements - the island, the cloud, and the island map - into a cohesive and visually stunning environment. 

Key developments included the procedural generation of islands based on the map created in Milestone 1. This step was crucial in bringing a sense of realism and diversity to the island shapes and formations. The clouds, were also procedurally generated, adding an additional layer of depth and realism to the environment. We also modified the cloud density and incorporating lighting effects to enhance the visual impact.

However, we encountered a challenge with Houdini's long loading times, likely due to the complexity of our objects. To address this, we made the tough decision to remove certain elements, such as vines and grass on the islands, to facilitate smoother rendering. This optimization was necessary to maintain the project's momentum and ensure that we could effectively integrate and render the merged elements. We will try to tackle this limitation in for the final project presentation.

### Exploration and Planning for Advanced Features

In addition to the integration work, we explored additional features to enrich our environment. We looked into Houdini plugins for Unity, which could potentially offer new avenues for integrating our procedural elements into a more interactive platform. Furthermore, we are planning to incorporate a bird flocking Unity asset into our current procedural island setup. This addition is expected to add a dynamic and lifelike element to our islands, enhancing the overall immersive experience.

### Reflection and Future Directions

This milestone was not only about technical advancement but also about learning to balance ambition with feasibility. The removal of certain elements, while a compromise, taught us the importance of flexibility and adaptability in complex projects. As we move forward, our focus will be on polishing these integrated elements and ensuring seamless functionality within Unity for our final demonstration.

Our journey continues with the shared goal of creating a visually captivating procedural island environment and we are excited to see how our project evolves in the next phase.

  ## Island Object Generation (Crystal Zou)
  ### Objective:
  The primary goal of Milestone 1 was to craft a realistic and visually captivating island environment in Houdini. This involved a series of intricate procedures aimed at simulating natural terrain and elements.
  Below is the rendered image of the island with vines: 
  ![Milestone1 Island with vines](https://github.com/Cryszzz/final-project/blob/main/images/Island%20Houdini.png)
  
  ### Implementation:
  The journey began with the creation of the main island. Here, I employed node point jitter to shape the terrain, followed by a refinement of node displays for enhanced visualization. To bring the main island to fruition, I employed a color gradient, utilizing it to drive mesh displacement, thereby laying down a foundation for the subsequent stages.

  The process then moved to the construction of a Druid Stone Circle, a task that allowed me to delve into the Houdini boolean tools. These tools facilitated complex operations including carving and merging geometries. The placement of the stones was achieved through the strategic use of a copy stamp node, pivotal for imparting a randomized yet coherent appearance to each stone. This phase included the arrangement of stones in a grid circle pattern, crafting a basic stone box shape, and applying boolean operations. The process was further refined by subdividing nodes, adjusting transform modes, adding surface noise, and incorporating elements of randomness to infuse the circle with a touch of authenticity and depth.

  Next, I focused on crafting a small stone wall that would gracefully trace along a curve.The key step in this process was the alignment of the normals with the curve, ensuring a natural flow and contouring of the wall. I achieved the desired randomization through the strategic use of a Group Expression node, complemented by a series of adjustments in the viewport, curve type modifications, segment length fine-tuning, jitter settings optimization, and precise definition of curve tangents. The culmination of these efforts was a stone wall that was not only randomized in its placement but also perfectly attuned to the island's topography.

  The final task in this milestone was the creation of vines. Initially, I experimented with a scatter node and a foreach loop, seeking a method that offered precise control and intricate detailing. However, encountering challenges with this approach, I transitioned to a hair simulation method, which proved to be a more effective and efficient solution. This successful implementation, however, is not the end of the journey. I am committed to revisiting and refining the initial foreach loop method, aiming to further perfect this technique in future project iterations for more realistic effect.

  ## Cloud Simulation (Keyu Lu)
  ### Objective:
  The primary objective of this milestone was to develop a dynamic cloud simulation that realistically mimics the movement, merging, and interaction of clouds in a natural environment.
  
  ### Approach and Technologies Used:
  To achieve this, I employed  Houdini metaball to simulate the dynamic behavior of clouds. This method allowed for the creation of clouds that not only move fluidly but also interact with each other in a natural way, such as merging or bouncing off each other.
  
  ### Fine-Tuning Details:
  **Mountain Noise Integration**: To add a touch of realism, I incorporated mountain noise node. This addition helps in simulating how clouds interact with mountainous terrain, effectively changing their shape and movement patterns.
  **Cloud Noise Enhancement**: To further refine the cloud's appearance, I added Houdini cloud noise. This ensures that each cloud has a unique, lifelike texture, enhancing the overall visual appeal.

  # Island Map Generation (Ruijun(Daniel) Zhong)
  ### Objective:
  The objective is to create a randomly generated map with unique island shapes and sizes, utilizing the wave function collapse method. The core concept is to generate a map pattern where each island's characteristics are determined by the underlying pattern.
  ![](./images/milestone1_demo_daniel2.png)
  ![](./images/milestone1_demo_daniel3.png)
  ### implementation:
  To begin, I crafted a pattern texture in Photoshop, meticulously arranging pixels to simulate a distinct pattern. This custom pattern serves as the foundation for the map generation process. The map generation leverages the wave function collapse node, which uses the created pattern as a base to spawn a diverse range of island shapes and sizes using following information & algorithm:
  * Area Calculation: The area of the grid cell is determined.
  * Radius Computation: Using the area, the radius for a torus that fits this area is calculated.
  * Center Positioning: The center of the grid cell is computed by averaging the positions of the cell's points.
  * Island Spawn: Create new primitives from the second input and position to the center. Calculate the size and characteristics based on grid area and radius.
