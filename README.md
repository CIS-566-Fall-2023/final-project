# CIS 5660 Final Project: Procedural Texturing of Solid Wood with Knots

## Design Doc

### Introduction 
 * Wood texture is a frequently utilized element in various applications and can be generated through procedural methods. However, many existing techniques tend to overlook the significance of knots, which can compromise the overall quality of the resulting texture. Consequently, we aim to create an efficient tool based on the paper [Procedural Texturing of Solid Wood with Knots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3528223.3530081) that will empower artists to procedurally generate lifelike wood textures, taking into account both living and deceased knots.

### Goal
 * Implement the algorithm presented in [Procedural Texturing of Solid Wood with Knots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3528223.3530081).
 * Integrate the algorithm into a Blender add-on for user-friendly utilization.
 * Generate wood textures in Blender using the tool to evaluate its performance.
