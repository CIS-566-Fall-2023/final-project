# Final Project!

For the final project of this class, we (Hansen and Kisha) would like to create an isometric room generator!

## Design Doc

### Introduction
When brainstorming ideas for our final project, we came across isometric rooms and thought they were very visually pleasing. We hope to be able to create a tool that will allow users to easily generate procedural isometric rooms that are able to match the visual quality of the ones we've seen online.

Due to the endless variety of room types, we have a lot of freedom in regard to the different combinations of objects we want in our rooms. There is also an endless number of possible ways to place said objects and a lot of freedom to explore and play around with the look and feel of each room. We hope that our final tool will be able to incorporate all the aesthetic aspects of the isometric rooms while also maintaining a certain amount of proceduralism. 

### Goal
Our goal is to develop a tool using Houdini that can create different iterations of aesthetically pleasing isometric rooms.

### Inspiration/reference:
Here are some reference photos of the type of room and look we are going for!

### Specification:
- Be able to procedurally generate different types of isometric rooms
- Creating an assortment of procedurally generated assets and procedurally placing the objects in each room
- Involve user customization by exposing parameters that can be modified
- Create and render pretty rooms using our tool!

### Techniques:
- Binary or Ternary Space Partition for Asset Placement
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_partitioning
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning
- L-Systems and Shape Grammars for Asset Generations
- Various tutorials on modeling certain furniture
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1opgcYYQCpE 
- Possibly Wave function collapse for giving the user control of asset placement

### Timeline:
Because we are using Houdini and we think itâ€™s best if we work on the project file together, we will be doing our best to meet up in person to complete each milestone.

**Week 1 (11/9 - 11/15)**
- Create a basic working tool that can procedurally place different pieces of furniture that we will substitute with boxes.

**Week 2 (11/16 - 11/27)**
- Begin to procedurally create a variety of assets and ensure that they are able to be placed into the room properly.

**Week 3 (11/28-12/5)** 
- Polish the scenes by implementing colors, different lighting, and exposing more parameters for the user to be able to interact with.
