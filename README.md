#### Introduction
We were inspired to create this character by the various beautiful visuals of our favorite video game characters. 

#### Goal
Create a render of a ginkgo-themed character using a mixture of procedurally and manually modeled assets, procedurally-created textures, and procedural effects of ginkgo leaves falling off the dress. 

#### Inspiration/reference:
Design is based on a combination of traditional chinese clothing and fantastical elements. Inspired by Mihoyoâ€™s Honkai Impact 3rd character designs.

(Original design by Jackie Li)

#### Specification:
- Manually modeled in Maya: hair decorations, clips, pins, shoes
- Manually modeled in ZBrush: figure, hair
- Manually modeled in Marvelous Designer: dress
- Procedurally modeled in Houdini: ginkgo leaves on bottom of dress/ sleeves
- Procedurally textured in Substance Designer/Painter: dress fabric textiles
- Cel-shaded in Unreal: hair, skin
- Unreal particle sim: effects of leaves falling off dress

#### Techniques:
For ginkgo branch: 
- Houdini VEX and Node systems
- L-systems

Texturing: 
- Cel-shading/ bucketing
- Vertex painting (lerp) for blending between materials on a mesh

Unreal Engine:
- Shaders (Post processing and surface)
- Particle Simulation
