# Introduction
Fantasy maps are awesome, and awesome procedural graphics people make them. One of the most iconic fantasy maps is the Marauder's Map from Harry Potter!

# Goal
We would like to develop a tool that procedurally generates a map of a Hogwarts-like campus which shows where everyone inside is walking about.

# Inspiration/Reference
We were primarily inspired by the Marauder's Map from the Harry Potter series.
While looking for reference materials, we came across this Marauder's map someone created for a themed Halloween party:

Important features that we want:

Walls made of text. A roughly rectangular but overall non-uniform footprint

Circular towers and curved hallways around them. Rooms in concentric rings. Possible change in level of detail at different zoom levels.

Not just block rooms -- some slanted hallways

Rooms that go into other rooms, not just into hallways
