Because sampleScene recooked with new procedural assets is too big for github, we use a temp workaround to keep the basic cube/sphere geometries in sampleScene.

On local machine, double click on temp_XXX models, turn off/disable base geometry (usually cube/sphere) and turn on/enable actual model. Rebuild & recook corridor hda to see the results.
